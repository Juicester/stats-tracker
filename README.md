## Get Started Instructions

When you open the app using the Heroku Link above you will bbe opened two a listing of 10 random games. You can either search for a game with the search form or check out the other tabs like "Hall of Fame" and "New Releases"

## Add-ons For the Future

I would like to add the following functionality:

- Add error checkers to inputs
- Change Limit to a dropdown from an Input
- Fix Column bug
- Make all images the same size
- Add Media Queries
- The biggest add on is to add a Link to each game div that takes you to a new page with all the additional information
