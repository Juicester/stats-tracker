# Stats-Tracker

This React App is a video game stats tracker

## Project Description

My project is called My Stat Tracker. It is a stat tracker app for the video games that I play. My friends and I often play tournaments on the weekends and I would love to develop a tracker for everyone to keep up with their scores. There are different APIâ€™s for different games so I would have to do different queries for each one. Users will see a couple of famous streamers profiles with their stats and a search bar to input their own stats. In the future I may add a page for our actual tournaments to keep track of who is winning in real time.
